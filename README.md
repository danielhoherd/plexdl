Starting from scratch building a plex direct downloader. The whole point is to not get media that has not been transcoded.

# Usage

```
git clone https://wherever/plexdl.git
pipsi install --editable .
export PLEXDL_USER='foo'
export PELXDL_PASS='bar'
plexdl Westworld
```

# TODO

- cleanup
- tests
